You can also get different shaft types, just make sure that it is a linear taper",https://www.taydaelectronics.com/tayda-100k-ohm-linear-taper-potentiometer-round-shaft-pcb-9mm-6-35-mm.html
"R21, R31, R33",3,Tall Trimmer 100K,"If you are in the US, synthcube is probably the place to get these, however, sometimes, the total price from Thonk can be cheaper. If you don't want to make a special order just for these 3 pots, you can find shorter alternatives on Tayda. If you buy normal metal shaft versions, just keep in mind that the holes on the front panel are not big enough. You can probably drill them out pretty easily if you want to go that route",https://synthcube.com/cart/song-huei-9mm-panel-trim-pot-tall?search=song%20huei%20tall&description=true
